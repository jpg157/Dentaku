# Dentaku

Dentaku is VikingsDev's open source messenger bot.

## Setting up a development environment

1. Fork the Dentaku repository: https://github.com/VikingsDev/Dentaku. <br>
    (If you don't know what forking is, [this example](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) could be helpful.) <br>
1. Clone the fork. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Dentaku.git` <br>
    (Please input your Github username in place of `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`.) <br>
1. Create a virtual environment. `python -m venv venv` <br>
    (If needed, install virtualenv with `pip install virtualenv`.)
1. Create an export file. <br>
macOS/Linux: `touch export.sh` <br>
Windows: `Notepad export.sh` and accept the prompt to create the new file (or create the file manually in File Explorer) <br>
1. Edit `export.sh` using a text editor, and add:
    ```
    export EMAIL="YOUR_FACEBOOK_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
    export PASSWORD="YOUR_FACEBOOK_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD"
    export BITLY_GAT="YOUR_BITLY_GENERIC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```
    > Note: Replace the strings with your own information, but keep the quotation marks! <br>
    > Get your bit.ly [Generic Access Token](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps), which is required if you want to use commands with link shorteners. <br>
    > (Remember to hit save in the text editor before activating the variables!) <br>
1. Activate the variables and venv. <br>
    macOS/Linux: `source export.sh` `source venv/bin/activate` <br>
    Windows: (The variables are automatically set when main.py is run)   `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` <br>
1. Install the required packages. `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
1. Run the bot. `python main.py` <br>
    You should see this:
    ```
    Logging in [YOUR_FACEBOOK_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]...
    Login of [YOU_FACEBOOK_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] successful.
    Listening...
    ```
> Keep Dentaku running and check your Messenger! You should have received a message from yourself, saying "Dentaku is online." Test the 'help' command by sending `!help` to the chat. <br>
> Now you can make your own commands by following the guidelines below. :)


## Contribution guidelines

For a full, comprehensive read on contribution, take a look at our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

To add your own command, create a file named your command. For example, if I 
wanted to make a command called dog, and I wanted users to run it as `!dog`, I would create a file
called `dog.py`

Inside `dog.py`, start with this template: <br>
(Replace all occurrences of 'dog' with your command name.)
```
from command import Command
from fbchat import Message
from fbchat import Mention


class dog(Command):

    def run(self):
        response_text = "@" + self.author.first_name + " Hello world! This is a dog command."
        mentions = [Mention(self.author_id, length=len(self.author.first_name) + 1)]

        self.client.send(
            Message(text=response_text, mentions=mentions),
            thread_id=self.thread_id,
            thread_type=self.thread_type
        )

    def define_documentation(self):
        self.documentation = {
            "parameters": "None",
            "function": "Undefined."
        }
    
```
For more information on defining parameters and functions, look for the `self.documentation` variable on [Dentaku's Wiki](https://github.com/VikingsDev/Dentaku/wiki/command.py). <br>
